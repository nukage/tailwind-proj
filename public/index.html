                       <p class="mb-3">  Thanks for your interest in playing one of our Open Mic events. Our electronic open mic is a showcase of local musicians who perform their original music.  We welcome performers, producers, and DJ’s, and we’re looking for electronic musicians who want to showcase their original music.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">This is an open mic in the sense that we’re open to anyone who wants to play, but we do create the schedule ahead of time, so you can’t show up the day of the show without signing up and expect to play.  This is to minimize confusion the day of the show, and we don’t want people showing up thinking they can play, and then not being able to accommodate them.  Slots are given on a first-come-first-serve basis, so in order to ensure you have a slot, sign up as soon as the even is announced.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">We do our best to promote the events through our own channels, but if we want to make these events as successful as possible, every artist who plays should be inviting their friends and promoting via their own social media channels or mailing list, so keep that in mind.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mb-3">When you play one of our events, you will need to set up fairly quickly because we want to fit as many performers in as possible.You should plan accordingly and perhaps simplify your setup if it takes a long time to set up.
                        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3 font-normal">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-4">If this is an open showcase, can I just come the day of the event and play?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Nope, you absolutely must sign up ahead of time, using the form on this site.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Will I be guaranteed a slot if I sign up?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Right now, we have roughly 8 slots available per event, and on average we have twice that many sign ups each month, so not everyone who signs up will be able to play.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">When will I know if I have a slot?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">We generally try to send the schedule out approximately 7 or more days before the event.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Is there anything I can do to increase my chances?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">If you help out by promoting our events heavily on social media or volunteer to help with the meet up, it will increase the likelihood you'll be prioritized in scheduling. Speak with an organizer for more specifics on this.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Do I need to play original music?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">This is a showcase for artists, if you are a DJ and you don't make original music, sorry but this event is not for you.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">What if I have confirmed my time slot, but something came up and I can't play?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Let us know as soon as possible. If it's the day of the show, <strong>TEXT OR CALL, DO NOT EMAIL!!!</strong> One of the organizers' phone numbers will be in the confirmation email for your slot.  If you don't let us know according to this standard, you won't be able to be scheduled for any future events.  We have had a really big problem with people not showing up for their slots so we had to put this policy in place.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Can I bring particular equipment?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">The main consideration here is setup time, if your equipment takes more than 10 minutes to set up, it's probably not appropriate for this event, but it's also dependent on your ability to set up quickly. Ask an organizer for more specifics on this.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">Can I perform using the existing equipment at 343 Labs / Scratch DJ Academy?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Since we accommodate electronic performers of all types and we need setup times to be as quick as possible, we encourage people to bring their own DJ controllers that are easy to set up. We don't have enough space to leave DJ equipment set up throughout the event, and it's heavy and takes more than 5 minutes to set up and break down.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">How long do I have to set up?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Your set length includes any time you need to set up, so if your set is 20 minutes long and you need 10 minutes to set up, you will only have the remaining 10 minutes to perform. This is the only way we can keep the night moving along, sorry! <strong>Practice setting up and breaking down at home, and time yourself so you know how long it takes!</strong></p>
        <h3 class="mb-4">How do I reach the organizers?</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Email: <a href="mailto:tom@iheartproducers.com">tom@iheartproducers.com</a></p>
