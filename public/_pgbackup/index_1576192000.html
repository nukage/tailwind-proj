                            <p>This year, Nukage has raised the bar yet again. Using his knowledge of sound design as well as guitar prowess, he created a show conceptualized to truly play his music live.  His guitar becomes a filtered, distorted ‘reese’ bass, which is then further modulated into growls, screeches, and wobbles. Audiences aren’t sure whether to dance or mosh, all the while cheering for more gurgling bass.</p>

                            <p> Inspired from a young age by the sounds of synthesizers and heavy metal guitars, Tom Myruski aka Nukage, set out to create a unique sound combining two things: the incredibly complex beats of electronic music, and the melodic stylings of progressive heavy metal.</p>
                            <p>Somewhere along the way, he encountered heavy bass music via artists like Skrillex, Bassnectar, and Kill the Noise and he was hooked. Within only a few months of releasing his first dubstep remix, he had his first hit with Zedd – Clarity (Nukage Remix). It was featured on ThisSongSlaps and was listed as one of the top remixes for that song. Since then, Nukage has been turning twisting, filtered bass and meticulously crafted beats into undeniable, funky filth.</p>

                            <p>So get the new album now, load up the tracks, and brace yourself. Because as Kolourbridge Records once wrote, his beats are “as seismic as they are meticulously well-written.”</p>

                            <p class="mb-3"> Thanks for your interest in playing one of our Open Mic events. Our
                                electronic open mic is a showcase of local musicians who perform their original music.
                                We welcome performers, producers, and DJ’s, and we’re looking for electronic musicians
                                who want to showcase their original music.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">This is an open mic in the sense that we’re open to anyone who wants to
                                play, but we do create the schedule ahead of time, so you can’t show up the day of the
                                show without signing up and expect to play. This is to minimize confusion the day of the
                                show, and we don’t want people showing up thinking they can play, and then not being
                                able to accommodate them. Slots are given on a first-come-first-serve basis, so in order
                                to ensure you have a slot, sign up as soon as the even is announced.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">We do our best to promote the events through our own channels, but if we
                                want to make these events as successful as possible, every artist who plays should be
                                inviting their friends and promoting via their own social media channels or mailing
                                list, so keep that in mind.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">When you play one of our events, you will need to set up fairly quickly
                                because we want to fit as many performers in as possible.You should plan accordingly and
                                perhaps simplify your setup if it takes a long time to set up.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3 font-normal">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">If this is an open showcase, can I just come the day of the event and play?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">Nope, you absolutely must sign up ahead of time, using the form on this site.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Will I be guaranteed a slot if I sign up?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">Right now, we have roughly 8 slots available per event, and on average we have twice
                        that many sign ups each month, so not everyone who signs up will be able to play.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">When will I know if I have a slot?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">We generally try to send the schedule out approximately 7 or more days before the
                        event.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Is there anything I can do to increase my chances?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">If you help out by promoting our events heavily on social media or volunteer to help
                        with the meet up, it will increase the likelihood you'll be prioritized in scheduling. Speak
                        with an organizer for more specifics on this.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Do I need to play original music?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">This is a showcase for artists, if you are a DJ and you don't make original music,
                        sorry but this event is not for you.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">What if I have confirmed my time slot, but something came up and I can't play?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">Let us know as soon as possible. If it's the day of the show, <strong>TEXT OR CALL,
                            DO NOT EMAIL!!!</strong> One of the organizers' phone numbers will be in the confirmation
                        email for your slot.  If you don't let us know according to this standard, you won't be able to
                        be scheduled for any future events.  We have had a really big problem with people not showing up
                        for their slots so we had to put this policy in place.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Can I bring particular equipment?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">The main consideration here is setup time, if your equipment takes more than 10
                        minutes to set up, it's probably not appropriate for this event, but it's also dependent on your
                        ability to set up quickly. Ask an organizer for more specifics on this.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Can I perform using the existing equipment at 343 Labs / Scratch DJ Academy?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">Since we accommodate electronic performers of all types and we need setup times to
                        be as quick as possible, we encourage people to bring their own DJ controllers that are easy to
                        set up. We don't have enough space to leave DJ equipment set up throughout the event, and it's
                        heavy and takes more than 5 minutes to set up and break down.</p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">How long do I have to set up?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">Your set length includes any time you need to set up, so if your set is 20 minutes
                        long and you need 10 minutes to set up, you will only have the remaining 10 minutes to perform.
                        This is the only way we can keep the night moving along, sorry! <strong>Practice setting up and
                            breaking down at home, and time yourself so you know how long it takes!</strong></p>
                    <h3 class="mb-4">How do I reach the organizers?</h3>
