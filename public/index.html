                            <p>This year, Nukage has raised the bar yet again. Using his knowledge of sound design as well as guitar prowess, he created a show conceptualized to truly play his music live.  His guitar becomes a filtered, distorted ‘reese’ bass, which is then further modulated into growls, screeches, and wobbles. Audiences aren’t sure whether to dance or mosh, all the while cheering for more gurgling bass.</p>

                        <div class="sm:text-xl leading-loose p-4  ">
                            <p> Inspired from a young age by the sounds of synthesizers and heavy metal guitars, Tom Myruski aka Nukage, set out to create a unique sound combining two things: the incredibly complex beats of electronic music, and the melodic stylings of progressive heavy metal.</p>
                            <p>Somewhere along the way, he encountered heavy bass music via artists like Skrillex, Bassnectar, and Kill the Noise and he was hooked. Within only a few months of releasing his first dubstep remix, he had his first hit with Zedd – Clarity (Nukage Remix). It was featured on ThisSongSlaps and was listed as one of the top remixes for that song. Since then, Nukage has been turning twisting, filtered bass and meticulously crafted beats into undeniable, funky filth.</p>

                            <p>So get the new album now, load up the tracks, and brace yourself. Because as Kolourbridge Records once wrote, his beats are “as seismic as they are meticulously well-written.”</p>
